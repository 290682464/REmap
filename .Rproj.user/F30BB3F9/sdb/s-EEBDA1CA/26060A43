    "contents" : "Jekyll Clean\n============\n\n* Get it from [github](https://github.com/scotte/jekyll-clean).\n* See the [live demo](https://scotte.github.io/jekyll-clean).\n* See it [in action on my own blog](https://scotte.github.io).\n\nA simple and clean Jekyll theme using [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)\n(not to be confused with jekyll-bootstrap) that's easy to modify and very\nmodular in component and element reuse.\n\nIt uses Disqus for comments and includes Google Analytics support. Both of\nthese features are disabled by default and can be enabled via \\_config.yml. You\ncan also rip this code out of the templates if you like (footer.html and post.html).\nThe beauty of Jekyll - keep things clean... Jekyll Clean!\n\nThe theme works well on mobile phones, using a collapsable nav bar and hiding the\nsidebar. The links pane in the sidebar is available on mobile through the nav menu,\nand you can do the same thing for any other sections added to the sidebar.\n\nDon't forget to occassionally merge against my upstream repository so you can get\nthe latest changes. Pull requests are encouraged and accepted!\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nIf you don't have a blog already on github, start by cloning this repository.\nBest to do that directly on github and then clone that down to your computer.\n\nIf you already do have a blog, You can certainly apply this theme to your existing\nblog in place, but then you won't be able to merge as the theme changes. If you\nre-apply your blog history on top of this theme's **gh-pages** branch, it's then\neasy to update to the latest version of the theme. You also don't want to have to\ndeal with resolving old conflicts from your existing history, so you may wish to to\npush your existing master off to a new branch so you have the old history and start\na new branch with this as the start, merging in your \\_posts and other assets (after\ngit rm'ing the current \\_posts.\n\nNot ideal, but you have to make a choice - either apply it manually or base your\nblog off this theme's branch. Either way it will work, and both have their own\npros and cons.\n\nYou can setup an upstream tracking repository like so:\n\n```\n$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:scotte/jekyll-clean.git\n```\n\nAnd now when you wish to merge your own branch onto the latest version of the\ntheme, simply do:\n\n```\n$ git fetch upstream\n$ git merge upstream/gh-pages\n```\n\nOf course you will have to resolve conflicts for \\_config.yml, \\_includes/links-list.html,\nand \\_posts, and so on, but in practice this is pretty simple.\n\nThis is how I maintain my own blog which is based on this theme. The old history is\nsitting in an **old-master** branch that I can refer to when I need to.\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nThe content of this theme is distributed and licensed under a\n![License Badge](/images/cc_by_88x31.png)\n[Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode)\n\n    This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work,\n    even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation.
