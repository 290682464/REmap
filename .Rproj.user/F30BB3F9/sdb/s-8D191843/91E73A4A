Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.\n\nWhen you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(REmap)\nremap.init()\nknitrREmap(remap(demoC))\n\ngeoData  = get_geo_position(unique(demoC[demoC==demoC]))\n# this may take some time,be patient~\n\nknitrREmap(remapB(markLineData = demoC,geoData = geoData))\n\n\n```\n\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nplot(cars)\n```\n\nNote that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n",
